# Motion_dector

In this project I have used CV2 library in python to grap images from the webcame and detect any motion and keeping track of the motions.
in other words this is used to detect any objects entering and exiting the background environment and tracking the time these activities occur and finally presenting these activities in a form of Bokeh chart online to be monitored and analysed.

libraries used in this project:

Bokeh.plotting
Pandas
cv2
